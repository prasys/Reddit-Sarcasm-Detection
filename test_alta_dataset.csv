The right of way gives you the presumptive at-fault element, but you can also be contributorily negligent in causing the accident. One example of contributory negligence is speeding. (If you think of the accident as being 100% of a problem, then you speeding adds to that problem, and some of the blame is shifted on you. This is what happens in cases where people don't wear their seat-belts and are injured in a car accident, where wearing the seat-belt would have prevented a majority of the injuriues, and the jurisdiction's laws dictate that one must wear a seat-belt.) In this case, if the Lambo was speeding, the driver of the Mazda will probably be held for a majority at fault, but the Lambo's speeding needs to be factored in to the equation. The exact percentage will be determined by the courts and the quality of the lawyers hired by the insurance agency. If the Lambo was not speeding, and obeyed all traffic laws before the crash, then yes, the driver of the Mazda will most likely be 100% at fault."
